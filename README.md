# SortPerformance

## Quick Sort
Three methods for choosing a pivot:

	1.	Pick the first element of the array. 
	2.	Pick a random element from the array.
	3.	Pick the middle element 

Creation of the arrays

The timing of the Quicksort is also dependent on the size of the array and how the array is currently ordered.  Execute the Quicksort algorithm with the following array possibilities of varying sizes:

	1.	Already ordered	
	2.	Reverse ordered	
	3.	Randomly ordered 

## Merge Sort & Heap Sort
For input sizes of 50,000, and 75,000 create 3 arrays:

	1.	Already ordered	
	2.	Reverse ordered	
	3.	Randomly ordered 
  
# Radix Sort

##### acdes	asdsd	ksjtr	kerpt	absqa	zabaa	rkdsb	qqqqq kdfaa	zedsd

Print the order of the strings after each pass.
